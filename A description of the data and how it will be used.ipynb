It is crucial to find proper sources of data for your analysis. The assignment will focus on data regarding car accidents in the city of Leeds, UK. The dataset was retrieved directly from the UK government\u2019s website: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/6efe5505-941f-45bf-b576-4c1e09b579a1/road-traffic-accidents/datafile/c885f604-ee28-418d-a988-160cde514756/preview\n\nThis dataset includes a set of information regarding car accidents in Leeds in the year 2019. Pretty good, since it is up-to-date.\n\nOnce imported all the necessary libraries and the data needed (in this case we will use a csv file imported directly in the notebook) we are ready to observe the data and, if necesary, clean the dataset from raw data and get it ready for analysis. One step more is to look for data types in your datasets.\n\nHere is the list of all the variables in the dataset including their datatype.\n\n1. **Grid Ref: Easting** --> int64\n2. **Grid Ref: Northing** --> int64\n3. **Number of Vehicles  --> int64\n4. **Accident Date** --> object\n5. **Time (24hr)** --> int64\n6. **1st Road Class** --> int64\n7. **1st Road Class & No**  --> object\n8. **Road Surface** --> int64\n9. **Lighting Conditions** --> int64\n10. **Weather Conditions** --> int64\n11. **Local Authority** --> object\n12. **Vehicle Number**  --> int64\n13. **Type of Vehicle** --> int64\n14. **Casualty Class** --> int64\n15. **Casualty Severity** --> int64\n16. **Sex of Casualty** --> int64\n17. **Age of Casualty** --> int64\n\nNow this data will be manipulated, filtered and prepared in such a way that will favour the data modelling stage. The data will be used for the purpose of suggesting proper methods to mitigate the risk of car accidents based on machine learning algorithms built with the variables that most impact road safety and car accidents occurrance.\n\n\n"
